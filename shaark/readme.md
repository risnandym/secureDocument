**Shaark is a self-hosted platform to keep and share your content: web links, posts, passwords and pictures.**

All of your data can be **private, public or both** and can be browsed by **tags** or **all-in-one search**.

**Shaark** is production ready, inspired by [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), built with [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

## Contribute

### Features and bugs

All contributions are welcome! Please use the `dev` branch for your pull requests.  
If you make changes to JS, don't compile assets in production, I'll manually compile them when merging for security reasons.

### Translation

Shaark is actually available in ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª, ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ and ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. Feel free to make a pull request to add or update a localization. 
You can see laravel base localizations [on this repo](https://github.com/caouecs/Laravel-lang). 

## Security

If you find any **security issues**, please send me an email (can be found in composer.json).

### Global privacy

If you don't want your content being publicy accessible, you can update this preference once application is installed from settings section.

### 2-FA

You're able to active 2-FA (2 factors authentication). By default 2-FA is disabled but you can update it from your app settings. 
Code length and code expiration are also configurable. **Test if you application can send emails before enabling this feature**.

### Auth monitoring

Shaark logs all successful and failed auths with their associated devices.

### Chests encryption

Since `1.2.9`, all chests data are encrypted in your database using AES-256-CBC and your app key.

### Multi-users

Others users can be admin or non-admin. Admin users are like the main user and have an access to the entire content. 
Non-admin users can't access the settings section and can only see their own private content.

## Tests

1. Be sure to have a testing database with `touch database/testing.sqlite` and have composer `require-dev` dependencies installer.
2. Run testing server `php artisan serve --env=testing`.
3. Run tests ```php artisan dusk --env=testing```
